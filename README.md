# Image-Filters 
The "Sketch" filter will turn images into (what looks like) hand-drawn sketches
The "Two Tone" filter emphasises the shadows in pictures by replacing pixels with just two different colours 
The "Crystallise" filter recreates a frosted glass effect, or with some slightly different settings, a mosaic effect
